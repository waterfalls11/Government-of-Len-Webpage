# Updates to the National Government
Following the ratification of the new Constitution, we have implemented a new government structure. This updated Constitution ensures that the Government operates more efficiently, transparently, and fairly for its citizens. It better equips us to uphold the rights of our citizens and pass legislation to protect them. Most citizens may only notice minor changes.

## What We Changed

### Overview
The new Constitution has become the supreme law of Len. All legislation previously enacted has become nullified. All new laws and Government actions must comply with the Constitution.

### Executive Branch
The Executive Branch is led by the Prime Minister and Vice Prime Minister, who share equal authority. This branch oversees all ministries and the enforcement of laws. Responsibilities include executing High Court decisions, enforcing laws, and managing Government operations.

### Parliamentary Branch
The Parliamentary Branch consists of all members in the Parliament of Len. Parliament is responsible for passing legislation, establishing internal rules, and making decisions related to government operations. Each province is represented by one member in Parliament.

### Judicial Branch
The Judicial Branch consists of the High Court of Len and the Civil Court of Len. The High Court, with 2 justices, interprets the Constitution, ensures compliance, and resolves disputes within the government. The Civil Court, with 3 justices, handles civil and criminal cases.
